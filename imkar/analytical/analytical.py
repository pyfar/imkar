    """
    This function computes the scattering coefficient of a sine-shaped surface
    (with infinite extend) for a given set of frequencies and angles.

    The function implements the method by Holford and Urusovskii with the
    implementation given by Embrechts [#]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    frequency_vector : array, double
        Vector of frequencies the scattering coefficient is computed at.
    phi_vector : array, double
        Vector of incidences phi the scattering coefficient is computed at.
        Values between -90째-90째 allowed.
    theta : double
        Out-of-plane incident angle of incoming waves. Values between -90째-90째
        allowed.
    c : double
        Speed-of-sound used for the computation.

    Returns
    -------
    s : FrequencyData
        The analytical solution for the scattering coefficient of a
        sinusoidal surface at the given incidences and frequencies.
